## Project Description
I choose to create a hangman game, because it is a fun game and it is not too complicated to code, since this is my first project. 

## Rules
The player has to guess a predefined word. During each turn the player guesses one word. If the player guesses wrong one attempt is gone. In total the player has six attempts, which she can fail. If the player guesses a right letter no attempt is gone.
The failed attempts are visualized by the "hangman".

## Workflow
1. Define word list.
2. Define game.
    - Create variables which are updated duting game: searched word, letters the player has guessed, number of attempts
    - Create loop which checks whether the player has guessed wrong or right
    - Visualizie stage of game with predefined pictures of hangman
 
3. Main function which calls all sub functions to pklay the game.
## Organization
Since the structure of the game is not complicated, everything is stored in one file.
